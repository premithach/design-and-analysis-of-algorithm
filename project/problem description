>The shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. 
>SJN, also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN). It is the job or process scheduling algorithm that follows the non-preemptive scheduling discipline. 
>In this, scheduler selects the process from the waiting queue with the least completion time and allocate the CPU to that job or process.
>Shortest Job First is more desirable than FIFO algorithm because SJF is more optimal as it reduces average wait time which will increase the throughput. 

•SJF algorithm can be nonpreemptive as well as non-preemptive. Preemptive scheduling is also known as shortest-remaining-time-first scheduling. 
•In Preemptive approach, the new process arises when there is already executing process. 
•If the burst of newly arriving process is lesser than the burst time of executing process than scheduler will preempt the execution of the process with lesser burst time. 

>Completion Time is the time required by the process to complete its execution 
>Turnaround Time is the time interval between the submission of a process and its completion. 
>Turnaround Time = completion of a process – submission of a process 
>Waiting Time is the difference between turnaround time and burst time 
>Waiting Time = turnaround time – burst time
